create counter  #create initiates counter to be 0 by default

#defines x with:
#an instance variable i
#count is a whileloop and the all while print i is the statement of the while: 
#while(i<7){ print i, i=i+1}
#i will automatically increase by 1
function x will create i and count from i to 7 all while print i 

#defines y with:
#do x = calling the function x = x()
#increase counter by 1 = counter++
function y will do x and increase counter by 1 and print "counter = " + counter

#do NUM Id does the given Id, NUM number of times
#in this case it does y twice
